# MultiSafepay plugin Shopware 6

We are proud to be developing our own Shopware 6 plugin that will soon be available for you to try out.

Be aware that we do not yet offer a fully functional and stable Shopware 6 plugin. Shopware 6 itself is currently in Early Access and it is meant for the community to try it out and improve it at an early stage.

Please note that certain significant pieces of functionality are not fully implemented. This release should not be used on live/production environments, as it may contain bugs and/or limited functionality. Our primary goal is to reach out to interested developers and work together on creating a seamless product to be launched in the first official release.

In this, there is a chance for you to be among the pioneers of Shopware 6 as part of a new e-commerce revolution, as well as an opportunity to become an active voice in the MultiSafepay community.

## What is Shopware 6?
Shopware 6 is the sequel to Shopware 5, a popular open source ecommerce platform. For more information, make sure you check out [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/shopware-6/).
